                    <strong>Significance:</strong> Understanding the preferred genre of video games is crucial as it reflects players' deeper connections and inclinations. Knowing the most popular genre can aid developers in making informed decisions about where to invest their efforts in game development.<br><br> <strong>Approach:</strong> To determine the most liked genre of video games, we will utilize a bar graph that compares different genres against their corresponding UserScores or CriticScores. By doing so, we can pinpoint the genre with the highest ratings, indicating the one that resonates the most with players and critics alike. This analysis will provide valuable insights for developers and the gaming community.<br><br><strong>Graphical Visualization</strong>

                    <strong">Result: </strong> From the two graphs, we can see that

                <div class="question-content">
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Understanding the most used gaming platform is crucial for game developers as it directly influences their target audience and game distribution strategies. Knowing the platform preferences of players allows developers to optimize their game's compatibility, tailor user interfaces, and offer a seamless gaming experience. This knowledge empowers game developers to prioritize platform-specific features and make informed decisions that resonate with their player base.<br><br><strong>Approach:</strong> To know which platform is most used
                        for playing games, we can plot the graph between Number of users vs the platform used. This

                    a critic score above 90)</h2>
                <div class="question-content">
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Identifying the developer with the most highly-rated games is of paramount importance for game enthusiasts and buyers. A critic score above 90 serves as a robust benchmark for judging games from a critical perspective. Players often rely on these ratings to make informed decisions about purchasing games that offer exceptional gameplay, storytelling, and overall gaming experience. For game developers, achieving high critic scores not only boosts their reputation but also attracts a larger player base, leading to greater success in the competitive gaming market.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Approach: </strong> There are two ways to look at this
                    problem. One by graphical analysis and other by dataset skimming. We can plot the graph between
                    number of highly rated games (critic score above 90) vs the top 3 developers. This gives us a
                    solution and to find out which games are top for each developer, we need to do dataset skimming.
                    Both of which are shown below.

                        <strong>Significance:</strong> Identifying the year with the highest number of game releases holds immense significance for the gaming industry. It offers valuable insights into the trends and factors that led to a significant boom in game sales during that specific period. Understanding the factors that contributed to increased game releases can help game developers, publishers, and corporations make strategic decisions to replicate successful trends and capitalize on the potential for higher revenue and market growth. This knowledge allows the gaming industry to align their resources and efforts effectively, ensuring they stay ahead of the game in this dynamic and competitive market.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Approach:</strong> To determine the year with the highest number of game releases, we employ a bar graph, plotting the number of game
                        releases against each year. This graphical representation provides a clear visual indication of the peak year when the
                        gaming industry witnessed a substantial surge in game launches.<br><br>
